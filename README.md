# Bank-Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on building an intelligent system that detects potentially fraudulent bank transactions using advanced data science and machine learning techniques. It leverages a dataset of anonymized transactions (often imbalanced) and uses classification models to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

The project includes:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand transaction patterns and anomalies
Data Preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding, and feature scaling
Imbalanced Data Handling using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling
Model Training with algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks
Model Evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC due to class imbalance
Visualization of important metrics and feature importance for interpretability
Deployment Ready Code for integration into financial systems or APIs.

Key Objectives - 
Detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
Minimize false positives to avoid customer inconvenience.
Build a scalable and explainable model for real-world deployment.
