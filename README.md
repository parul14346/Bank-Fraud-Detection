# Bank-Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on building an intelligent system that detects potentially fraudulent bank transactions using advanced data science and machine learning techniques. It leverages a dataset of anonymized transactions (often imbalanced) and uses classification models to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
